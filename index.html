                    <p class="f-para">Sanskrit is a classical language within the Indo-Aryan branch of Indo-European languages.
                        Emerging in South Asia after the Bronze Age, it played a pivotal role as the sacred language of
                        Hinduism, classical Hindu philosophy, and historical texts of Buddhism and Jainism. Serving as a
                        link language in ancient South Asia, it spread with Hindu and Buddhist cultures to Southeast
                        Asia, East Asia, and Central Asia, influencing formal vocabularies.</p>
                    <p class="s-para">Sanskrit encompasses various Old Indo-Aryan language varieties,
                        with Vedic Sanskrit being the
                        oldest found in the Rigveda (1500 BCE - 1200 BCE). Classical Sanskrit, a refined form codified
                        by Pāṇini in the 1st millennium BCE, marked a significant development. Notable works like the
                        Mahābhārata and Rāmāyaṇa were composed in Epic Sanskrit between 400 BCE and 300 CE. Over time,
                        Sanskrit became tradition-bound, ceased as a first language, and stopped evolving as a living
                        language.</p>

                    <p><span>1.</span> The term "Sanskrit" is derived from the
                        compound word sáṃskṛta-, where sáṃ means
                        'together, good, well, perfected,' and kṛta- means 'made, formed, work.' This conveys the idea
                        of a work that is "well prepared, pure, perfect, and sacred," emphasizing tonal qualities over
                        semantics.</p>
                    <p><span>2.</span>
                        In ancient India, sound and oral transmission held immense value, leading sages to refine the
                        alphabet, word structure, and grammar into what they called Sanskrit—a "sublime musical mold."
                        The late Vedic period witnessed a fascination with resonating sound and its musical foundations,
                        permeating linguistic, philosophical, and religious literature.</p>
                    <p><span>3.</span> Sanskrit competed with vernacular Prakritic
                        languages, termed prākṛta-, meaning
                        "original, natural, normal, artless." Patañjali recognized Prakrit as the instinctive first
                        language, acknowledging its imperfections. Sanskrit, seen as purifying, resolved linguistic
                        issues. Early grammarians like Daṇḍin noted that Prakrit retained Sanskrit roots but suffered
                        from "loss of sounds" and grammatical neglect. Despite differences, both languages coexisted,
                        with scholars like Namisādhu viewing Prakrit as natural and Sanskrit as a refined form through
                        "purification by grammar."</p>

                    <p class="ani">The early history of writing Sanskrit and other languages in ancient India poses challenges,
                        despite extensive scholarly efforts. The earliest possible script, from the Indus Valley
                        civilization (3rd/2nd millennium BCE), remains undeciphered. If any scripts existed in the Vedic
                        period, they have not been preserved. Scholars generally agree that Sanskrit was spoken in an
                        oral society, and an oral tradition preserved the extensive Vedic and Classical Sanskrit
                        literature.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="points">
                    <h1 class="ani">Scholarly Debates:</h1>
                    <p class="ani">- Some scholars argue for an oral society basis, citing inconsistencies in transmitted versions
                        of literature from various cultures. They contend that the vastness and consistency of Vedic
                        literature make it improbable to have been solely composed and transmitted orally across
                        generations without being written down.</p>
                    <h1 class="ani">Lipi and Early Mentions:</h1>
                    <p class="ani">- Lipi, meaning "writing, letters, alphabet" in Sanskrit, contextually refers to scripts or any
                        manner of writing. Pāṇini's Astadhyayi, from the 5th or 4th century BCE, mentions lipi in the
                        context of a writing script and education system but does not specify the script.
                    </p>
                    <h1 class="ani">Buddhist and Jaina Texts:</h1>
                    <p class="ani">Early Buddhist and Jaina texts list numerous writing scripts in ancient India, but the historical
                        value of these lists is questioned. The empirical evidence of writing systems for Sanskrit or
                        Prakrit inscriptions before the 3rd century BCE is lacking.</p>
                    <h1 class="ani">Challenges in Explaining Cultural Complexity:</h1>
                    <p class="ani">- The absence of evidence for writing systems before the 3rd century BCE raises questions about
                        the evidently high level of political organization and cultural complexity in ancient India. The
                        difficulty lies in explaining these aspects without a writing system for Sanskrit and other
                        languages.</p>
                    <h1 class="ani">Datable Writing Systems:</h1>
                    <p class="ani">- The oldest datable writing systems for Sanskrit include the Brāhmī script, related Kharoṣṭhī
                        script, and Brahmi derivatives. The Brāhmī script later evolved into various Indic scripts and
                        Southeast Asian scripts.</p>
                    <h1 class="ani">Ashoka's Inscriptions:</h1>
                    <p class="ani">- The rock edicts and pillar inscriptions of the 3rd century BCE Mauryan emperor Ashoka, though
                        not in Sanskrit, represent extensive surviving inscriptions from this period.</p>
